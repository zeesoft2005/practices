# About maths.ts
## History
Maths.ts started as a university project. It's creator's (Hector) only goal was to handle real numbers on JavaScript, this because of the accuracy lost on some floating point numbers operations.

Have you ever had problems when you try to multiply: 10000.000001*100? It supposed to be 1000000.0001, but JS does not produce that output. According to JS 10000.000001*100 equals 1000000.0001000001. Well, there are some cases where this accuracy lost is very annoying.
 
 As Hector continue with this library development, he realized he could attach every  other project math related to this library, such as some linear algebra algorithms, graph algorithms, numeric methods algorithms, etc.
 
 ## Overview
 Maths.ts pretends to be also an educational library, so it provides step-by-step executions on some algorithms, all you have to do is provide an empty array where the algorithm may save all the steps.

Maths.ts also pretends to be a developing library that helps other developers to build more complex applications.
