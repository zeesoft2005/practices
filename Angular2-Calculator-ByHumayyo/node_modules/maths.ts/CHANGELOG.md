# History
In this file you'll see the progress over the versions released.

## 2017/07/1, 0.0.2
A little functionality added for graphs. Now its possible to execute some well known graph algorithms: (DFS, BFS, Uniform cost search, greedy, A*).

There was an improvement too in the reading of inputs through Node class. Node is a class for representing expression, it builds any math expression as a tree. Still work to be done, though.

## 2017/06/20, 0.0.1
Published for the first time as maths.ts on Node Package Manager. No functionality yet, empty repo.
