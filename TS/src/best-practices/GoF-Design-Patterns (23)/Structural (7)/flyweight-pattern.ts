/**
 * Flyweight is a structural design pattern that allows 
 * programs to support vast quantities of objects by keeping their memory consumption low
 * 
 * Flyweight pattern is primarily used to reduce the number of objects created and to decrease memory footprint and increase performance. 
 * 
 * Use the Flyweight pattern 
 * only when your program must support a huge number of objects which barely fit into available RAM.
 * It’s most useful when:
1- an application needs to spawn a huge number of similar objects
2- this drains all available RAM on a target device
3- the objects contain duplicate states which can be extracted and shared between multiple objects

In Flyweight pattern we use a HashMap that stores reference to the object which have already been created,
 every object is associated with a key. Now when a client wants to create an object,
 he simply has to pass a key associated with it and if the object has already been created we simply 
 get the reference to that object else it creates a new object and then returns it reference to the client.

 So in effect, it's more like a combo of Singleton and Factory patterns; where a factory keeps singleton instances of 
 similar objects and returns when asked from the hashmap of singletons based on type of instance passed in its factory method

 /**
 * The Flyweight stores a common portion of the state (also called intrinsic
 * state) that belongs to multiple real business entities. The Flyweight accepts
 * the rest of the state (extrinsic state, unique for each entity) via its
 * method parameters.
