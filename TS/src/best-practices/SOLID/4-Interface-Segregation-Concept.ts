/**
 * 
 * MAIN IDEA: Break/Segregate interfaces in pieces (called Role based interfaces) 
 * rather than make a big one (called a Header interface);
 * because, then the implementing types will have to implement all of them even if they don't need one
 * 
 * PRINCIPLE: No client should be forced to implement methods which it does not use, 
 * and the contracts should be broken down to thin ones.
