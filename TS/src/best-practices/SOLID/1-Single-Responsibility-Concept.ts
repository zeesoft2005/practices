/**
 * MAIN IDEA: "Create every job or logical concept of your program in the form of a class 
 * BUT that class should do just one job"
 * 
 * PRINCIPLE: 
 * This means that a class should not be loaded with multiple responsibilities and 
 * a single responsibility should not be spread across multiple classes or mixed with other responsibilities.
 * The reason is that more changes requested in the future, the more changes the class need to apply
