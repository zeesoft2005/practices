/**
 * Dependency Injection (DI) and 
 * Inversion of Control (IoC) are generally used as interchangeably to express the same design pattern
 * The principle says that high-level modules should depend on abstraction, not on the details,
 *  of low-level modules. In simple words, the principle says that there should not be a tight 
 * coupling among components of software and to avoid that, the components should depend on abstraction.
