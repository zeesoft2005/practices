/**
 * MAIN IDEA: "Don't add new changes in a class so that it changes previously implemented logic; 
 * adding new functionality should be adding new code (e.g. functions, etc) but not alter old code"
 * 
 * PRINCIPLE:
 * Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, 
 * but closed for modification in its existing implementation
